To entertain a half deceased,
Is craving homage, and has found
My uncle used to be so sound,
And do not make a step aside!
And think: Oh gosh, when will you die!
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
That could not make a better deal.
But after falling gravely ill
But what a boredom is the session:
It is for others a good lesson,
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
What mean deceitfulness it is:
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To watch a sick man day and night
