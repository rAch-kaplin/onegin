My uncle used to be so sound,
But after falling gravely ill
Is craving homage, and has found
That could not make a better deal.
It is for others a good lesson,
But what a boredom is the session:
To watch a sick man day and night
And do not make a step aside!
What mean deceitfulness it is:
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To entertain a half deceased,
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
And think: Oh gosh, when will you die!
